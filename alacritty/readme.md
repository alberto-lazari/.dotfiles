# Alacritty
Basic configuration, mostly tested on macOS, with a color scheme inspired by [onedark.vim](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim)

## Scripts
- The [`update-icon`](update-icon) script is used to change the macOS icon to a better one (the original one sucks)
- The [`spawn-new-instance`](spawn-new-instance) one is used to create a new window on the same working directory of the current selected one (on macOS).
  It is useful to avoid the use of tabs (standard command + N behavior) when having decorated windows, since it causes a mess with tiling WMs
