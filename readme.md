# Dotfiles
My personal collection of dotfiles for macOS and Linux systems

## Installation
Clone the repo in your home directory with
```bash
git clone https://github.com/albertolazari/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
```

Then run the [`install`](install) script that automatically creates the symlinks and sets up installed programs

`-h or --help` for usage and available options

## Custom setup
Every optional program configuration is configured with a `program/setup` script, that installs the base configuration, along with custom plugins
